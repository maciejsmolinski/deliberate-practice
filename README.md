# Deliberate Practice Board

A totally for-fun project inspired by Kathy Sierra's talks and books promoting the idea of deliberate practice. I used to keep these in airtable and link skills to different deliberate practice exercises that would help me go from the "Can't do" to "Mastered" state in a short amount of time.
